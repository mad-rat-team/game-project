### Technology justification
We decided to use Unity as the game engine. It is a fairly popular choi—Åe especially for indie development. Unity has enough tools for our project, such as a 2D isometric tilemap. All functionality is greatly documented. Also it free to use and due to its popularity there are a lot of courses, guides and articles, which will make development a lot easier.

We are using Krita for design and drawing purposes. It is free and open source, has great functionality for our tasks and its interface is user-friendly.
