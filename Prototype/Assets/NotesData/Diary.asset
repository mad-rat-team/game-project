    Diary'
  - For a long time I've been thinking about whether what we're doing makes sense?
    No, I like it here. All things considered, the food isn't bad, everyone treats
    each other with respect. The only problem is probably the rats.
  - We have managed to restore the water supply to this complex, we are now free
    to use it. However, we had to shut off other people's water supply for a while.
    And worst of all, our group was interfered with by one of the workers.
  - As a result, as far as I know, he was badly injured. Although he just wanted
    to do his job.
  - I just recently found out a horrible thing by accident. It turned out that every
    time the group goes out at night into the city, they rob shops with food. That
    explains why we have fresh produce in our warehouse all the time.
  - I recently received a note from A. Ivo, directing the group to get poison for
    rats in the same way. On the one hand, stealing is a terrible thing, but on the
    other hand, we have to live too....
  - In spite of everything, I've decided it's time for me to run. I plan to quietly
    leave one night. I don't know if I will succeed and what I will do next, but
    I definitely don't want to stay here anymore... As long as I don't break something.
