  - "Yesterday afternoon in the northern district of the city there was an unscheduled
    water shutdown in 23 residential houses. Some nearby structures were also affected.\r\nThe
    causes are still being investigated. A team of workers has already arrived at
    the scene, but the water supply has not yet been restored.\r\nResidents complain
    about the impossibility to do household chores. The timing of the restoration
    of water supply is still unknown.\r\nOne of the workers was attacked during the
    work. As a result of the attack, the worker suffered several fractures and bruises.
    The victim was taken to a nearby hospital. The police are looking for the attackers.\r"
